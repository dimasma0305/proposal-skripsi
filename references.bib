  abstract = { Browser fingerprinting remains a topic of particular interest for both the research community and the browser ecosystem, and various anti-fingerprinting countermeasures have been proposed by prior work or deployed by browsers. While preventing fingerprinting presents a challenging task, modern fingerprinting techniques heavily rely on JavaScript APIs, which creates a choke point that can be targeted by countermeasures. In this paper, we explore how browser fingerprints can be generated without using any JavaScript APIs. To that end we develop StylisticFP, a novel fingerprinting system that relies exclusively on CSS features and implicitly infers system characteristics, including advanced fingerprinting attributes like the list of supported fonts, through carefully constructed and arranged HTML elements. We empirically demonstrate our system's effectiveness against privacy-focused browsers (e.g., Safari, Firefox, Brave, Tor) and popular privacy-preserving extensions. We also conduct a pilot study in a research organization and find that our system is comparable to a state-of-the-art JavaScript-based fingerprinting library at distinguishing devices, while outperforming it against browsers with anti-fingerprinting defenses. Our work highlights an additional dimension of the significant challenge posed by browser fingerprinting, and reaffirms the need for more robust detection systems and countermeasures. },

// This article serves as a comparative algorithmic survey that mathematically traces the evolution of plagiarism detection, moving from surface-level formulas like Jaccard Similarity (which treats text as overlapping sets to find exact copies) to deep semantic metrics like Cosine Similarity and Wu-Palmer Similarity (which calculate geometric or hierarchical distances to detect paraphrasing and AI-generated content),,,.

ABSTRACT={Plagiarism in academic and creative writing continues to be a significant challenge, driven by the exponential growth of digital content. This paper presents a systematic survey of various types of plagiarism and the detection algorithms employed in text analysis. We categorize plagiarism into distinct types, including verbatim, paraphrasing, translation, and idea-based plagiarism, discussing the nuances that make detection complex. This survey critically evaluates existing literature, contrasting traditional methods like string-matching with advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning approaches. We highlight notable works focusing on cross-language plagiarism detection, source code plagiarism, and intrinsic detection techniques, identifying their contributions and limitations. Additionally, this paper explores emerging challenges such as detecting cross-language plagiarism and AI-generated content. By synthesizing the current landscape and emphasizing recent advancements, we aim to guide future research directions and enhance the robustness of plagiarism detection systems across various domains.}}
